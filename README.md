# cocotb-stubs

Includes Python typing stubs for [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) and related packages: pygpi, cocotb_bus, and others.

## Installation

```sh
pip install cocotb-stubs
```

## Support

Not all interfaces or modules in cocotb are supported by the stubs.
Many interfaces in cocotb *appear* to be public, but are not.
Some modules in the cocotb namespace *appear* to be public, but are not.
And some modules or classes are simply not covered for other reasons.

Any special notes will appear here.
